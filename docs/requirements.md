# Requirements

## Splunk requirements

To install and configure the IBM DataPower Add-on for Splunk, you must be running Splunk 7.0 or newer and must have the admin role in the Splunk platform.

Because this add-on runs on the Splunk platform, all of the system requirements apply for the Splunk software that you use to run this add-on.

For Splunk Enterprise system requirements, see [System Requirements](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/Systemrequirements) in the Splunk Enterprise Installation Manual.
If you plan to run this add-on entirely in Splunk Cloud, there are no additional Splunk platform requirements.
If you are managing on-premises forwarders to get data into Splunk Cloud, see [System Requirements](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/Systemrequirements) in the Splunk Enterprise Installation Manual, which includes information about forwarders.

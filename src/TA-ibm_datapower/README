# IBM DataPower Add-on for Splunk 

## System requirements
- IBM DataPower 7.5 or newer 
- Splunk 7.0 or newer

### Installation on Splunk Enterprise

### Installation on Splunk Cloud
This app is packaged using Splunk app package toolkit 1.0, which won't allow self-service app install (SSAI) in Splunk 7.1 and below. For those versions of Splunk, Cloud Support needs to unpack the app, remove its app.manifest, and repackage the app using Splunk app package toolkit 0.9, and then install.

## Configuration
### Splunk
- Configure a new index (e.g. waf) for the new logs

#### Receiving syslogs on Splunk
NOTE: Its recommended to use a separate and dedicated syslog solution (e.g. rsyslog, syslog-ng, etc)
- Configure new TCP port (e.g. 514) pointing to the new index using the "ibm:datapower:syslog" sourcetype

#### Monitoring log files
- Configure a new file monitor input pointing to the new index using the "ibm:datapower:syslog" sourcetype

### IBM DataPower
- Configure syslog outputs
